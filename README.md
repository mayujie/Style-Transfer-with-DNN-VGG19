## Separating Style and Content
Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, target image which should contain our desired content and style components:

- objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the content image
- style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the style image
